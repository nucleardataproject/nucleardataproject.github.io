The **Nuclear Data Project (NDP)** is a dedicated scientific resource for the systematic archiving and analysis of quantitative data pertaining to nuclear architecture. The nucleus is a non-randomly organized organelle, and the spatial distribution, morphology, and dynamic behavior of its sub-nuclear bodies are critical determinants of genomic function. This repository addresses the critical need for a centralized, standardized database of nuclear parameters to facilitate advanced analysis and modeling.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive, searchable library of high-resolution datasets, enabling the rigorous investigation of structure-function relationships within the nucleus across various organisms, cell types, and physiological or pathological conditions.

## Core Scientific Objectives

1.  **Data Curation and Standardization:** To acquire, validate, and archive high-quality datasets featuring precise morphometric and spatial data on nuclear bodies (e.g., nucleoli, nuclear speckles, PML bodies, Cajal bodies). All entries are annotated with detailed experimental metadata.
2.  **Pattern Identification and Analysis:** To serve as a foundational resource for the identification of conserved principles and quantitative patterns governing nuclear organization and the interrelationships between nuclear bodies.
3.  **Predictive Model Development:** To enable the creation and validation of computational models that predict nuclear architecture based on cellular state, and conversely, to infer cellular conditions from nuclear organization.

## Database Access and Utility

The NDP interface allows for complex querying of the database based on multiple orthogonal parameters:

*   **Biological Specimen:** Organism, cell type, tissue origin, and cell line.
*   **Experimental Condition:** Cell cycle stage (e.g., G1, S, G2, M), metabolic state, response to stressors (e.g., DNA damage, osmotic shock, transcriptional inhibition), and disease context (e.g., cancer subtype, laminopathy).
*   **Nuclear Target:** Specific nuclear bodies or structures, with data on protein/composition markers used for identification (e.g., Fibrillarin, SC35, Coilin, SP100).
*   **Data Modality:** Source microscopy technique (e.g., Confocal, TEM).


## Data Specifications

Each dataset within the repository provides downloadable assets in standardized, lossless formats to ensure reproducibility and facilitate computational analysis:

*   **Primary Imaging Data:** Original, unprocessed image stacks (e.g., `.tiff`, `.czi`).
*   **Derived Quantitative Data:** Coordinate sets (2D/3D), morphometric measurements (volume, sphericity, intensity), and inter-body distance matrices in comma-separated value (`.csv`) format.
*   **Complete Metadata:** Adhering to OME standards, including full experimental protocols, acquisition parameters, antibody information (clone, RRID), and contributor affiliation.

## Contributing

The scientific community is invited to contribute datasets to enhance the breadth and depth of this resource. Submitted data undergoes a curation process to ensure compliance with project standards for annotation and quality control.
